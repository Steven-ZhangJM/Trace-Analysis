# Trace-Analysis
This project mainly analyzes EDGAR weblogs with one day's data. Including the IP-check and sort the data. In the IP check, we analyze with the IP range to determine the location. We change the IP more formally, for example, from integer ip 16843009 to ip 1.1.1.1. And we sort the IP in ascending order. Finally, we will create an SVG image based on the data analyzed.
